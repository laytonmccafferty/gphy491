Most material for this course was developed by Cascade Tuholske, Montana State University.  While specifically developed for MSU students, this course leverages materials from UCSB EDS2017, developed by Prof. Kelly Caylor, and from An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science, developed by Prof. Ryan Abernathey.
